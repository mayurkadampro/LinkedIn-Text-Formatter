## ✨ About  
**LinkedIn Text Formatter** is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you style your LinkedIn posts effortlessly. Since LinkedIn doesn’t support native text formatting - no HTML tags, no ASCII tricks - this tool leverages **Unicode characters** to bring rich text styling to your posts.  

## 🔹 Why Build This?  
LinkedIn restricts custom styling, making posts look monotonous. Inspired by platforms like **LeetCode, Discord, and Twitter**, which use Unicode for text styling, this tool was built to improve **engagement, readability, and visual appeal** of LinkedIn posts.  

## 🌟 Features  
- ✅ **Format text instantly** – bold, italic, underline, emojis  
- ✅ **One-click copy** – easy pasting into LinkedIn posts
- ✅ **Live Preview** of typed text
- ✅ **No complex setup** – just type, format, copy, and post!  
- ✅ **Completely free & open-source**
